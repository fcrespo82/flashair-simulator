# Toshiba [FlashAir](https://flashair-developers.com) simulator

This project aims to facilitate the process of developing software that uses the FlashAir APIs since the FlashAir card is not always available and has some restrictions (such as uptime).

The server was not exhaustive tested and neither includes all [API](https://flashair-developers.com/en/documents/api/) functionalities.
